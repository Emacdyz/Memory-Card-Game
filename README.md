It's build using `create-react-app`. You first need to `yarn` in order to get all the dependencies locally. To start the app `yarn start` can be used.

The backend (server) of this project must be running for the app to function correctly.

2 - Users:

* `GET /users`: list all users
* `GET /users/:id`: select user by id
